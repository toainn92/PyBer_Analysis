# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The end result is to create a multiple-line gaph that shows the total week fares for each city type by using Pandas and Matplotlib. This analysis will summarie how the data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

To begin the analysis, the two following files were used:
- ride_data.csv
- city_data.csv

These two files were merged into one data frame and the data table is shown below:

Here are the conclusion from the summarized data table:

- Urban cities have the highest amount of total rides, drivers, and fares. However, their average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the lowest compared to Rural and Suburban cities. This could be because the riders don't long distance in big cities.

- Suburban cities have the middle amount of total rides, drivers, fare, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver compared to urban cities and rural cities. This means that subrban cities have lower amount compared to urban cities anad have higher amount compared to rural cities.

- Rural cities have the lowest amount of rides and drivers, but with highest amount of average fare per ride and per driver. This could be because the riders are going longer distance resulting in higher fare prices.


## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
